# Image Caption Generator

## Objective 

To develop an image captioning system that can automatically generate accurate and meaningful captions for images to aid visually impaired individuals in understanding the content.

## Experimental Setup

<b>Dataset:</b> Flickr 8K

<b>Model Architectures:</b> We experimented with four different models for image captioning:
<li>VGG (architecture) with RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)</li>
<li>VGG with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)</li>
<li>Inception (architecture) with LSTM</li>
<li>Inception (architecture) with 2 LSTM layers</li>
<li>Inception with LSTM and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)</li>
